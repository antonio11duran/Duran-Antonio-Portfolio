# Duran-Antonio-Portfolio

This project is a work in progress of the work I am completing during my bootcamp. It is a a portfolio I will continue to work on to showcase my work and develop my skills.
This will project is primarily for myself, but it will also be used to send to potential employers. This page has my contact information, as well as 5 projects I have or will be working on.
Links are at the top of the page to help navigate and there are also links that showcase my work.

## Usage

There are navigation links at the top of the page that can be used to navigate through the main 3 headers of the page. Another link goes to my resume. This link will work once my resume is finalized.

In the work section, each box has a link to go to the project listed. In the future, these will go to the actual applications of work, but since we have not completed any, I have only included link to my github repositories.

In the contact me section, my phone number is listed as well as other ways to get into contact with me. For email, github, twitter, and spotify, pressing the link will send you to a fake email/link.

## Credits

www.w3schools.com was a useful tool in creating this portfolio. Their tutorials assisted with my flexboxes as well as the hover attribute that was attached to them.
