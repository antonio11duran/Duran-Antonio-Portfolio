      <p>
        My name is Antonio Duran, and I am a Full Stack Developer. I am set to
        complete a coding boot camp in February 2023. I enjoy working in a MERN
        Stack setting, and being a part of the full development process. I live
        in the Denver-metro area with my wife and energetic Husky. Outside of
        work I like to stay active in intramural soccer, volleyball, and
        basketball leagues. I enjoy story-driven and multi-player/team-based
        video games. My current favorites are Rocket League and Horizon. I enjoy
        solving puzzles both for fun and professionally. When I encounter a bug
        or issue that I haven't seen before, I like to use my resources,
        knowledge, and problem solving skills to identify the root issue and
        resolution. When I set my mind to it, there hasn't been an issue I
        haven't been able to resolve! Logic and coding have come easily to me,
        and I have really enjoyed expanding my knowledge during this boot camp.
        I look forward to connecting, and being a part of your professional
        network!
